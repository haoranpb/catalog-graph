## Background

Robb was the eldest child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Robb was born at Riverrun and raised at Winterfell. His father left his mother the morning after their wedding to fight in Robert's Rebellion and did not return until after Robb was born. Robb Stark was likely named after Robert Baratheon. He had two younger trueborn brothers, Bran and Rickon, and two sisters, Sansa and Arya.

Robb also had a "bastard half-brother" Jon Snow, with whom Robb shared a close relationship. Jon is actually his cousin by blood as he is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. Robb was also close to his father's ward Theon Greyjoy, whom he counted as his best friend outside of the family. He had been trained from childhood to wield a sword and wear armor by Winterfell's Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel and was highly proficient with both for his young age. He lived at Winterfell with his family.
