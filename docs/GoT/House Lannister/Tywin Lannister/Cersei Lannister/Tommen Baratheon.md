# Tommen Baratheon

King Tommen I Baratheon was the nineteenth ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and the younger brother of King Joffrey and Princess Myrcella. Though legally the son of the late King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, his true father is Ser Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother, and is thus a bastard born of incest.

After his brother's death, Tommen assumed the throne under the name of Tommen of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
