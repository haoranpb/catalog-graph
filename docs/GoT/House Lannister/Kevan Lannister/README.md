# Kevan Lannister

Ser Kevan Lannister was the younger brother of Lord Tywin Lannister and one of his most loyal and trusted officers in the Lannister armies during the War of the Five Kings.

After his brother's death at the hands of his nephew Tyrion, Kevan opposes his niece Cersei's seizure of power as leader of her son King Tommen's small council. Refusing his appointment by Cersei as Master of War, he departs the court in protest and returns to Casterly Rock.

When Cersei is arrested on various charges by the Faith Militant, Kevan returns to King's Landing and is appointed Hand of the King by Grand Maester Pycelle, until he is killed in the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, arranged by Cersei herself.

## Background

Kevan was the second son of the late Lord Tytos Lannister. He was the brother of Lord Tywin Lannister, the head of House Lannister and Lord of Casterly Rock. Kevan was married to Dorna Lannister of House Swyft - who King Robert characterized as "a dumb whore with a fat arse" - and they had a son Lancel, who was a squire to King Robert Baratheon. He was a noted knight who served his elder brother loyally as an adviser, and was respected for his wise and candid counsel.
