# Viserys Targaryen

Viserys Targaryen was the younger brother of the late Rhaegar Targaryen and the older brother of Daenerys Targaryen. Viserys and Daenerys were the remnants of the exiled House Targaryen following a rebellion against their father, Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King". He claimed the Iron Throne as King Viserys III following his father's murder, but never returned to Westeros, as he was killed by his brother-in-law, Khal Drogo, before he could take the throne.
