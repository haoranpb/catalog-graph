# Daenerys Targaryen

Queen Daenerys I Targaryen, also known as Daenerys Stormborn, and colloquially known as Dany, was the younger sister of Rhaegar Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen and only daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, who were both ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion. She also served a brief tenure as the de facto Queen of the Andals and the First Men and the twenty-first ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, after claiming the throne from her predecessor Cersei I Lannister, who was killed in the Battle of King's Landing. However, she was never formally crowned, nor did she sit upon the Iron Throne.

Daenerys was initially a timid, obedient youth. However, as time passed, she gathered confidence and followers, becoming a formidable conquerer and ruler.

Daenerys eventually succumbed to the "Targaryen madness" of her ancestors, due to a series of terrible losses (among them deaths of ones she loved and cared), and destroyed countless innocent people. As a result, she was assassinated by her nephew (and lover) Jon Snow to prevent further carnage. She was eventually succeeded by Brandon the Broken (an elective monarch chosen by the Great Council of 305 AC).

She formally styled herself as Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, though the style was occasionally shortened to Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

## History

Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King", and his sister-wife, Rhaella. Her father died during the Sack of King's Landing before she was even born. The usurper Robert Baratheon installed himself as king, having defeated Aerys in the conquest known as Robert's Rebellion. Her pregnant mother and brother Viserys, fled to the island of Dragonstone, the ancestral home of House Targaryen, to escape Robert. Daenerys's brother Rhaegar Targaryen was killed in the war by Robert. The forces of House Lannister murdered Rhaegar's wife, Elia Martell, and their children, Rhaenys and Aegon, during the Sack of King's Landing.

But unbeknownst to Daenerys and the rest of her family, her oldest brother Rhaegar had another son by Lyanna Stark, who died shortly after giving birth to him. In her final moments, she revealed the true name of their son, Aegon Targaryen, to her brother Eddard. To protect his sister's son, Eddard claimed the baby as his illegitimate son and named him Jon, who would grow up to be known as Jon Snow. Eddard raised Jon as his own child in Winterfell and Jon grew up with his maternal side of the family. Jon initially joined the Night's Watch but later became the King in the North.

On the night Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a severe summer storm raged. For this reason, she is sometimes called "Daenerys Stormborn". Her mother died soon after she was born, leaving Daenerys an orphan.

As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother, Viserys, by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry. After years spent fruitlessly trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys were given sanctuary by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. She dreams of finding a peaceful home and a place to belong to. Daenerys lives in constant fear of Viserys, who hits her when his temper is risen (in his words, whenever she "wakes the dragon"). Living under Viserys's domination has left her meek and malleable.
