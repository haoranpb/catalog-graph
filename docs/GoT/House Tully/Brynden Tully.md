# Brynden Tully

Ser Brynden Tully, popularly called "the Blackfish," was a knight and a member of House Tully. He was the younger brother of Lord Hoster Tully, and the uncle of Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure Tully.

## Background

Brynden Tully was the younger brother of Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun and head of House Tully, and the uncle of Catelyn, Edmure, and Lysa. Brynden is a respected knight and formidable battle commander, who first distinguished himself in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, nearly forty years before the War of the Five Kings.

Brynden often argued with his older brother Hoster, particularly over the fact that Brynden never married. When Brynden returned home from the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Hoster had already arranged for him to marry Bethany Redwyne, of the wealthy and powerful House Redwyne, similar to many other such matches in Tully history. Brynden refused the good match, however, refusing to be told when and whom to marry. Hoster was angry that Brynden would not enter into a marriage to improve the family, and said that he was the black goat of the Tully herd. Brynden joked that given that the Tully sigil is a trout, it would be more fitting to say that he was the "black fish" of the Tully school. The nickname stuck, and Ser Brynden became popularly known as "The Blackfish" ever since. Brynden even took to using a black fish in his own personal heraldry, which like the standard Tully heraldry it uses a red and blue background, but swaps out the normal silver trout for a black one. Hoster would attempt to contract other arranged marriage-alliances for Brynden over the years, many of them very promising matches, but Brynden turned down them all, which led to constant bickering between the two brothers throughout their lives.

Despite his disagreements with his brother over his refusal to marry, Brynden is very devoted to his family.
