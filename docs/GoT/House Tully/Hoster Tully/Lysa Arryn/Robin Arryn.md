# Robin Arryn

Lord Robin Arryn, commonly called "Sweetrobin" by his mother, is the only surviving child and heir of Lord Jon Arryn by his wife, Lysa of House Tully, who served as Robin's regent during his minority. He is the Lord of the Eyrie, the head of House Arryn, the Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale.

## Background

Robin was born in King's Landing where his father was serving as the Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon. Jon begins an investigation into Robert's legitimate and bastard children and then takes a fever and dies suddenly. Robin then inherits Jon's position. Lysa rushes Robin back to the Eyrie following Jon's death. She writes to her sister to accuse House Lannister of poisoning Jon. Lysa was fiercely protective of Robin. As a consequence, he has led an extremely sheltered life.
