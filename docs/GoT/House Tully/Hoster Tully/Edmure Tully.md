# Edmure Tully

Lord Edmure Tully is the Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident, the son and heir of the late Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. He is the younger brother of Catelyn and Lysa, nephew of Brynden "Blackfish" Tully, and maternal uncle of Robb Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, and Robin Arryn. Upon Robb's ascension as King in the North, he fought for his nephew during the War of the Five Kings.

After the his marriage to Roslin Frey, Edmure was held prisoner by his father-in-law, Walder. During the Second Siege of Riverrun, Ser Jaime Lannister used Edmure to force the Riverrun garrison, led by Brynden, to surrender. After the siege, Edmure was returned to his incarceration, though Arya later massacred the Frey male line upon her return from Braavos.

Edmure was restored to his titles and lands following the defeat of Cersei Lannister at King's Landing and the subsequent assassination of Daenerys Targaryen. He later participates in the Great Council of 305 AC; although he fails to win any support for his own ascension to the throne, he agrees to the crowning of Bran as King of the Andals and the First Men.
