He was formally styled as Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. His bastardy, however, would unofficially make him the first ruling king without any blood relation to House Targaryen, as he had no blood relationship to his legal father, King Robert, whose ancestor and the founder of House Baratheon, Orys Baratheon, was the bastard brother of King Aegon I Targaryen, commonly known as Aegon the conqueror. He is the older brother of Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon, both of whom share the same parentage. Joffrey's actions during his rule sparked the War of the Five Kings and ended when he was poisoned at his own wedding feast by Olenna Tyrell and Petyr Baelish.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
