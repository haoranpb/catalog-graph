# Vuepress-plugin-catalog-graph

Generate a elegant graph catalog for your VuePress documents.

> Status: WIP. I start many projects, hopefully I will finish this one.

## Inspiration

Normal catalog is boring. I want to generate a network graph catalog based on your document's structure, for you may need a more vivid display of relationships between each files or your document's structure may not be strictly tree-like.
